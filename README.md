# IDP
FA326 Interactive Design Concepts @ The Cooper Union

This repo contains an archive of my work for IDP. The class was very open ended, pick a goal and build it for the next class/demo day. A lot of it is scratch work and pretty messy code. I apologize.

Each branch contains the end status of a project. The current gh-pages branch contains the final project (which relies on the firebase connection that probably does not work now. You can deploy it to your own firebase database and setup the rules yourself)
